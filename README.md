# shapes

I made a pringle in VisPy.

It took me 10 hours.

## I want my own pringle

1. open a terminal
1. get [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
1. run `uv sync`
1. run `uv run pringle.py`
1. pringle

## Roadmap

- add better texture and flavouring on pringle
- more shapes
- public API
- IaC
- add chat bot
